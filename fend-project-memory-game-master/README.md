## HowToPlay 

Game involves matching 8 pairs of hidden cards randomly shuffled. Every click unhides a card and player attempts to open two matching cards. If the two opened cards match they remain open and if not they are hidden. Game ends when all pairs are matched or player looses all the stars in 25 moves.

Every match or an un-match countes as 1 move.
Player looses a star at 10th, 16th and 25th move.
